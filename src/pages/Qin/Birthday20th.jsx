          <p>
            First of all, I'm very much happy to see you turn 20 üéä.{' '}
            <i>It just feels like yesterday when you were 18 huhu.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            It feels like just yesterday we were jumping cafes and having fun all around. I still miss you buying
            chocolates and goodies and the hug you gave me when you got happy. I miss this feeling every day and I
            can't help but cry sometimes when I realize I can't do it right now, but I believe I can give you the
            world once this is over.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have added many goodies for you this time, and here is what everything signifies. I was ready to buy
            a lot of chocolates but the authorities won't allow it huhu.

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Shampoo, Serum:</strong> So that your hair remains as silky smooth as ever and you remember me
              every time you bath (same with the 3 things I can't mention here) üôà
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Light nail-polish:</strong> So that your fingers shine.

            <li>
              <strong>Watch:</strong> So that you know that the more the hand turns the more I'm nearer to seeing you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Facewash, Lotion, Moisturizer, Powder:</strong> So my baby is everything and her skin remains soft.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hair Clips and Hair Tie:</strong> So my baby's hair doesn't come in front when the wind is blowing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Necklace, Tops, and Earrings:</strong> So mero kanxu ko neck kali na dekhios and ghumkas for when
              she goes to parties or traditional looks.

            <li>
              <strong>Ring:</strong> So that she knows we are unofficially married already and it is going to happen. (I
              wanted to add a mangalsutra but I thought timi faint holau so garena haha)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Even though we're miles apart, I still feel so connected to you. Every day, I think about you, and I
            can't wait for the day we can be together again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Time has flown by so quickly, and every moment with you has been a treasure. The past few months you have
            been very strong and inspiring; tackling all the hardships one after another, being away from your
            family and love, but still working hard to see the good days. I'm very very proud of you dear and even
            if I am not there with you, I always think about you and pray you are doing well.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, here's to you, my love. <span className="text-pink-500 font-semibold">Happy 20th birthday!</span> May
            this year be filled with love, joy, and endless opportunities. I can't wait to create more beautiful

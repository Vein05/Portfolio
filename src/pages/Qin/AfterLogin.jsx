            <p>First of all, I'm very much happy to see you turn 20 üéä. <i>It just feels like yesterday when you were 18
                huhu.</i></p>
            <p>It feels like just yesterday we were jumping cafes and having fun all around. I still miss you buying
                chocolates and goodies and the hug you gave me when you got happy. I miss this feeling every day and I
                can't help but cry sometimes when I realize I can't do it right now, but I believe I can give you the
                world once this is over.</p>
            <p>
                I have added many goodies for you this time, and here is what everything signifies. I was ready to buy
                alot of chocolates but the authorities won't allow it huhu.
            </p>
            <ul className="ml-2 list-disc space-y-2 ">
                <li>Shampoo, Serum: So that your hair remains as silky smooth as ever and you remember me every time you

                <li>Facewash, Lotion, Moisturizer, Powder: So my baby is everything and her skin remains soft.</li>
                <li>Hair Clips and Hair Tie: So my baby's hair doesn't come infront when wind is blowing</li>

                <li>Ring: So that she knows we are unofficially married already and it is going to happen. (I wanted to

            </ul>
            <p>Even though we're miles apart, I still feel so connected to you. Every day, I think about you, and I
                can't wait for the day we can be together again.</p>
            <p>Time has flown by so quickly, and every moment with you has been a treasure. The past few months you have
                been very strong and inspiring; tackling all the hardships one after another, being away from your
                family and love, but still working hard to see the good days. I'm very very proud of you dear and even
                if I am not there with you, I always think about you and pray you are doing well.</p>
            <p>So, here's to you, my love. <span className="text-pink-300">Happy 20th birthday!</span> May this year be
                filled with love, joy, and endless opportunities. I can't wait to create more beautiful memories with
                you, celebrate many more birthdays together, and continue building our wonderful journey.</p>

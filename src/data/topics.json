Recently, I've also started to create my own sounds. While I'm not very skilled at songwriting, I'm open to expanding my horizons. I also enjoy reading novels, particularly fiction. It's a great way for me to spend my time and I'm always captivated by the imaginative scope and narrative depth of fictional works."
